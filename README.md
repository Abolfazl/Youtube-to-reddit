# Youtube to Reddit
This is the code used to power the [RT_Video_Bot](www.reddit.com/u/RT_Video_Bot) account.
This initial commit is for /u/Albuyeh, and is missing a lot of documentation, something I will fix over the next few days.

# Dependencies.
The bot runs on Python 2.7, using the Python Praw, requests and json libraries, as well as avinassh's excellent [prawoauth2](https://github.com/avinassh/prawoauth2)

#TODO
* Update the subreddit wiki upon each video upload.
* **Documentation**
